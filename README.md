Used Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning
# Used Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the selling price of used cars based on features such as car age, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and ownership details.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about used cars including:
- Present price
- Kilometers driven
- Fuel type
- Seller type
- Transmission
- Owner count

Target variable: **Selling_Price**

## Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering (Year → Car Age)
- One-hot encoding of categorical variables
- Model training using Random Forest Regressor

## Model Performance
- R² Score: **0.96**
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): **0.64**

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Conclusion
The Random Forest model performed very well in predicting used car prices and can be used to estimate fair market value.
